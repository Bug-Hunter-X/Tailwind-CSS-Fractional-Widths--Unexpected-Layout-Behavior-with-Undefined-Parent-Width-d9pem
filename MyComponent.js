```javascript
//MyComponent.js
<div className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <div className="flex space-x-4">
    <div className="bg-red-500 w-1/2"></div>
    <div className="bg-blue-500 w-1/2"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
This code will not work as expected in Tailwind CSS because of the usage of `w-1/2` which means `width: 50%` and the absence of any explicit width on the parent element.  The fractional widths will not work correctly unless the parent has a defined width.
